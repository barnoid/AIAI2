In another part of the museum, a group of friends huddled together, examining a display featuring a man in a blue sweater. "This exhibit is so cool," one of the friends said, pointing to the statue. "It looks just like him!" The man in the blue sweater, who was standing nearby, smiled at the friends and said, "I'm glad you think so. It's nice to have a statue of me in the museum." The friends laughed, "No, seriously, this is awesome!" They continued to talk, discussing the exhibit and the significance of the man in blue.
