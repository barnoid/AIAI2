The woman in the striped shirt sips her coffee, and she looks out the window, observing the world beyond. As she does so, she feels a sense of calmness that washes over her, and she begins her day with a sense of determination. The woman in the living room, who is also seated, takes in the view and begins to think about the plans she has for the day. She is grateful for the opportunity to spend time indoors and reflect on her thoughts and goals. As she sips her coffee, she feels a renewed energy and focus, ready to take on the challenges and accomplishments that the day brings.
