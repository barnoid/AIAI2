As the movie crew sets up for the day's shoot, a few people can be seen around the lot, discussing the schedule and the upcoming scenes. A young woman, dressed in a black shirt and jeans, approaches one of the crew members. "Excuse me, do you know where the extras are supposed to line up?" she asks. The crew member, a tall man in a suit, smiles and replies, "Yes, they are over by the trailers. Just follow the direction signs." The woman nods her head and thanks him before walking off to find her group.
