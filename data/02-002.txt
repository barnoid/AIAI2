The woman is walking past an office building, her reflection in the glass of the store window. She looks down at the handbag she is carrying. It is a sunny day, but she is dressed in a brown coat, and her hair is pulled back in a bun. She appears to be focused on her destination, and the storefront with the vases is just a passing moment in her day.
