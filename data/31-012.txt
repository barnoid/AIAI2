"Yeah, I'm glad we stopped. The store had a great selection of clothing, and I'm really happy with what I got," the father replied, as he looked down at his new shirt.

"Yeah, me too. I'm glad we took the time to look around, and I can't wait to wear these new shirts to school on Monday," the daughter said with a smile.
