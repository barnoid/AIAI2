It is the middle of a rainy night in the city. People are walking on the wet sidewalk, under the glow of the street lights. A car is driving through the rain, its headlights illuminating the wet road. A man stands at the edge of the street, looking into the rain. He is wearing a leather jacket and a black hat.

It was a dark and rainy night in the city. People huddled under the street lights, trying to stay dry. A man in a leather jacket and black hat stood near the edge of the street, watching the rain fall. He looked into the rain, perhaps lost in thought or just enjoying the sound of the water. A car drove through the rain, its headlights casting a glow on the wet road. The man in the leather jacket and hat glanced up as the car passed by, and then he turned and walked down the street, into the rain.
