As the two women stand at the edge of the mountain, they take in the breathtaking view of the snowy landscape. They can see a couple of snowmobiles, one at the bottom of the mountain and another a little higher up. The air is crisp and cold, and the snow is so deep, they can barely see the ground. They're excited to go out and explore the mountain and have some fun.
