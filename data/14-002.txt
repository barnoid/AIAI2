A woman in a black dress was standing in front of a wall covered in graffiti. She had her hair pulled into a ponytail, and her eyes were closed. She was humming a tune, lost in her own world. A man in a suit and tie approached her, his eyes on the graffiti. He leaned in closer, trying to make out the message. "What do you think this graffiti says?" he asked. The woman in the black dress opened her eyes, and smiled. "It's beautiful," she replied. "It's like a piece of art."
