The dark sky was void of any stars, and the moon cast a shadow over the scene. Two people stood on the side of a road, looking over at an abandoned building. The first person was an older gentleman, wearing a brown vest and holding a pipe in his mouth. The second person was a woman with a young child, both of them standing close to the elderly man. They appeared to be discussing something, possibly the building's condition. The woman spoke up, "We should probably leave this area. There's no telling what's inside that building." The older man nodded in agreement, "Yes, it's better for us to move on. This place gives me the creeps."
