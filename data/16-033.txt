In the image, there are at least twelve people, some of them standing closer to the foreground, while others are situated further back. There is also a group of three people in the middle of the frame, possibly having a conversation or observing something in the distance. The overall atmosphere of the scene is one of anticipation, as the people appear to be waiting for something or preparing for an event.
