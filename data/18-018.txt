"Good evening, Miss," the man with the jacket and white hair greeted the young woman. "Is there anything I can assist you with?" He asked, his eyes twinkling with curiosity.

"Yes, can you tell me anything about this statue and the woman with the handbag?" The young woman asked, pointing to the statue of the woman.

"Ah, this is an ancient Egyptian statue, dating back thousands of years. The woman depicted is Queen Cleopatra, the last pharaoh of Egypt. The handbag she holds is said to have been made from the hide of a unicorn, and was said to have been gifted to her by Julius Caesar. The bag has a history of its own, and it's said to have been used by Cleopatra to sign the peace treaty that ended the Roman-Egyptian War." He explained, taking a step closer to the statue. "It's a fascinating piece of history."
