A woman in a tan coat and gray pants walks out of the front door of a building. She appears to be in a hurry, and is carrying a handbag. As she walks down the street, she glances at her reflection in a storefront window. The store is called "The Modern Vase", and it features vases of different shapes and sizes on display. As she passes the storefront, she continues on her way, her reflection continuing to follow her.
