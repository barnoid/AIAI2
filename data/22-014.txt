The image shows a man and a woman sitting together, looking out a rainy window at the spraying water from the fountain outside. They seem to be observing the waterfall or the water hitting the ground, perhaps enjoying the calming effect of the water. They are also engaged in conversation with each other, possibly discussing the fountain or sharing stories about their experiences.
