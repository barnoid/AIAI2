"But I don't want to go to sleep. I want to stay and play with my friends," the younger boy protested. The older boy sighed and gently placed the boy on the bed, tucking him in with a gentle kiss on the forehead. The little boy was sleeping soundly within minutes, his head resting comfortably on the pillows.

"Sleep well, little one," the older boy whispered as he softly closed the bedroom door, making sure the little boy was safe and comfortable.
