A man wearing a straw hat and a plaid shirt, sitting in the front row, was watching the event intently. He was the only person in the crowd with a hat on, and his shirt was the only plaid shirt in the room. He was a man of simple pleasures, enjoying the parade with the same level of excitement as everyone else. The man found himself caught up in the festivities, experiencing a sense of wonder and awe that is so often experienced during parades and other public events.
