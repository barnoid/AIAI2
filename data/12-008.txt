"Of course, I'm always here to help you. What's on your mind?"

"That's okay, we can work on it together. Just be honest and tell him how you feel. Trust that your feelings will be enough."

The letter becomes a reflection of her heart, and she knows that her father will appreciate the honesty and sincerity that she has poured into it.
