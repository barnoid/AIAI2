The man and the boy are standing in the woods, with trees surrounding them and the sky visible above. The man wears a jacket, providing a practical and functional layer to protect him from the elements. The boy looks up at the man, his eyes filled with admiration and determination. The man smiles, his eyes crinkling at the corners, and the boy returns his smile, feeling more confident and ready to face the world.
