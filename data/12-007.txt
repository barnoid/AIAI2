"Hey, Jess. I need some help with this letter. I'm not sure what to say."

"What letter? Who is it to?"

"It's for my dad. I wanted to tell him how much I miss him."

"Okay, just be honest and tell him how you feel. He'll understand."

"Thanks, Jess. I appreciate your advice. I'll call you back when I've written it." The woman hangs up, feeling more confident about her decision to write the letter. As she sits down to write, she reminisces about her father and the happy times they shared together. She pours her heart into the letter, expressing her love and gratitude for the man who had been such a significant figure in her life.
